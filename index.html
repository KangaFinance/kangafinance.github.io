									<p><b>Fast, cheap trades with low slippage.</b></br> Kanga Finance runs on Binance Smart Chain with low gas fees further optimized by our Token Management Framework that reduces fees even when trading across multiple pools. Low slippage is provided by our pluggable Liquidity Pool offerings which moving forward will support stableswaps, price oracles AMM's and liquidity bootstrapping pools.</p>

									<p><b>High Yield, Capital Efficient Pools </b></br>High yield provided by the Yield Engine which allows unused tokens to earn additional yield by moving them into the best managed yield provider. Yield is further increased by dynamic fees which adjust to trading conditions.</p>

									<p><b>Higher Yield for Staked Tokens</b></br>Liquid Staking allows Token Holders to stake Kanga and receive Liquid-Kanga which can be further staked in other yield providers. Moving forward yield will be further increased by Yield Strategies as introduced by yearn to ensure tokens are staked in the highest yield provider.</p>

									<b>Token Holders, Traders and Arbitragers</b>
										In addition to holding and swapping tokens, holders can combine multiple trades in a batch swap, provide liquidity by joining or exiting a pool, decide whether to leave their tokens in the POUCH as an internal balance or withdraw the assets back to the native token and create flash loans for arbitraging opportunities.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<p>
									<b>Yield Providers</b>
										Yield providers such as DeFi protocols like AAVE can use their managed assets to provide liquidity. This reduces the amount of assets needed to be held in pools and increases their yield by augmenting their existing fees with trading fees from the liquidity pools. Yield can be further increased by using more advanced yield strategies to improve yield similar to the strategies that YEARN introduced.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<p>
									<b>Asset Custodian</b>
									Asset custodians are any entity which manages assets. These include Layer 1 blockchains, parachains, DeFi protocols, centralized exchanges and traditional financial institutions. All of these custodians can increase liquidity for their assets (tokens). They can also increase liquidity for their platform, either by bridging to POUCH or moving forward implementing a POUCH light client on their platform.

									<b>Optimized Ledger and Custody: </b>
									The optimized ledger holds all balances of the Liquidity Pools on the Kanga. It allows for a single interface point with all liquidity pools and abstracts away the underlying implementation of the liquidity pools thus allowing a gas efficient platform and agnostic interface for the exchange of tokens.								</p>
							</div>
							<div">
								<p>
									<b>Optimized Routing and Settlement: </b>
									The off-chain swap routing enables the discovery of the best value for swaps via the Optimized Ledger. This includes all Kanga Liquidity Pools and may be augmented with on-chain components for realizing discovery fees.
								</div>
							<div>
								<p>
									<b>A Sample Trade</b>
										<ol>
											<li>Trader approves the Optimized Ledger to work as a proxy</li>
											<li>Trader requests to swap one BTC for some DOT</li>
											<li>The BTC is deposited into the Optimal Ledger (note: this optionally uses the Cross Platform Bridge if the assets come from another layer 1 platform)</li>
											<li>Optimal Routing selects the most efficient swap route from multiple liquidity pools and executes the trade</li>
											<li>The trader receives the DOT and then can either leave the DOT on the Optimal ledger or withdraw them using Optimal settlement (once again, if the funds are native to another layer 1 platform the Cross Platform Bridge will be used)</li>
										</ol>
									</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<p>
									<b>Yield Engine: </b>
									The Yield Engine connects Liquidity Providers to Yield Providers. Yield Providers invest in a liquidity pool. However, rather then sending all the invested tokens to the liquidity pool, only the minimum amount needed for transactions is sent. The role of the Yield engine is to monitor the balance of the liquidity pools and replenish and re-balance them as needed.
								</footer>
							</div>
							<div>
								<p>
									<b>OCS Yield Engine flow</b>
									<ol>
										<li>The Yield Provider (e.g. AAVE or Honza) "invests" a number of tokens into a liquidity pool.</li>
										<li>The Liquidity Pool maintains a minimum threshold needed for trading, which is called the Optimal Liquidity Amount. The remaining "investment" tokens are held in the Yield Provider enhancing the yield for the Liquidity Pool.</li>
										<li>When the number of tokens for any token in the pool drops below the Optimal Liquidity Amount, a re-balance is triggered (optionally using the cross platform bridge if needed).</li>
									</ol>
									<b>Note: </b>In the above scenario, BTC was traded for DOT thus triggering DOT to drop below its Optimal Liquidity Amount. Hence, DOT is replenished by the Yield Provider and BTC is withdrawn to balance the Liquidity Pool and continues to earn yield on the surplus BTC.
